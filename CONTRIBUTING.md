# Contributing to Prominic Roles

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains the
contribution process and expectations for the `prominic.prominic_roles`
Ansible collection.

## Scope

Prominic Roles is a collection of Ansible roles for Prominic's private and
public applications (GBAuth, JEDI, thin clients, system health). It follows
the `startcloud.startcloud_roles` conventions and is consumed by provisioner
packages that vendor it under `provisioners/ansible_collections/`.

## Prerequisites

- ansible-core 2.15 or later
- ansible-lint (the repo's `.ansible-lint` pins the `production` profile with
  `strict: true`)
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install lint tooling: `pip install ansible-lint`
3. Install collection dependencies: `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`
4. Run the linter from the repo root: `ansible-lint` — it must pass with zero
   failures and zero warnings.

## Role Conventions

Every role follows the `example_role` anatomy from `startcloud_roles`:

- `defaults/main.yml` — starts with `run_tasks: true` and the variable
  precedence comment; all defaults live here.
- `tasks/main.yml` — a single `when: run_tasks` block; every module by FQCN
  (`ansible.builtin.*`, `ansible.posix.*`, `community.general.*`); task names
  quoted and in gerund form ("Creating…", "Installing…", "Configuring…").
- `meta/main.yml` — full `galaxy_info` (role_name matching the folder,
  author, description, company, issue_tracker_url, SPDX license,
  min_ansible_version "2.15", platforms, tags) plus the `collections:` entry.
- `meta/argument_specs.yml` — every variable documented with type, default
  and description.
- `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` in the role root.
- Booleans are `true`/`false` (never yes/no); file modes are quoted strings
  (`"0755"`); commands declare `changed_when`.

Secrets never land in tracked files — real values live in the gitignored
root `vault.yml`, tracked files carry dummies or vault-var lookups, and
`galaxy.yml` `build_ignore` keeps `vault.yml` out of release artifacts.

## Testing

Roles with a `molecule/` directory carry container-backed tests
(`gbauth_client` and `system_health` today). Prerequisites: Docker plus
`pip install molecule "molecule-plugins[docker]"`. Run from the role
directory:

```bash
cd roles/system_health && molecule test
```

CI runs every scenario through the Molecule workflow's role matrix
(`.github/workflows/molecule.yml`) on pull requests — add your role to the
matrix when you add a scenario.

The thin-client roles (Raspberry Pi firmware paths) and `gbauthd`
(pfSense/OPNsense pkg installs) have no container-honest test story yet and
are verified on real hardware instead — don't add fake scenarios for them.
Planned lanes for closing that gap: arm64 containers via QEMU binfmt for the
thin-client roles (full coverage eventually via a packer-built Pi image under
QEMU), and a FreeBSD VM lane for `gbauthd`.

## Submitting a Change

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your change following the conventions above.
3. Run `ansible-lint` — zero failures, zero warnings.
4. Update `meta/argument_specs.yml` and the role README when variables or
   behavior change.
5. Write commit messages following
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`,
   `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`. release-please builds the version
   and CHANGELOG from them.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request; fill out the PR template.

## Adding a New Role

1. Copy the anatomy of an existing role (e.g. `gbauth_client`).
2. Check `startcloud.startcloud_roles` first — if a role there already covers
   the need, use it instead of duplicating; if a role here overlaps one
   there, note the subsumption in this role's README.
3. Add the role to the collection README's role list if one exists.
4. Run `ansible-lint` and open a PR.

## Releases

release-please manages versioning on `main`: merging its release PR stamps
`galaxy.yml`, tags a release, and the build workflow uploads
`prominic-prominic_roles-<version>.tar.gz` (+ latest alias + `.sha256`
sidecars). Consumers install from the release artifact — never via git
submodule.

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues first.
- Use the appropriate issue template (bug, feature request, question).
- Include: role name, collection version, target OS, and relevant task
  output (with secrets redacted).
